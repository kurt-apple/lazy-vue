# Lazy Vue (lazy-vue-quasar)

## Generic Vue Components
Have you ever wanted to prototype apps faster? Like, as fast as possible?

Have you ever not known what data will look like from an API, or what it will become once the project is more mature?

Lazy-Vue is a set of components that allow you to render any primitive, object, or array good enough.

# Features
- Supports Array, object, or primitive
- Fully and deeply reactive
- The data is editable when the component's edit prop is true
- Open Source

# To Do
- Template slots for each type of component, to allow developers to theme the lazy-vue component
- Publish to NPM
- Clean up the code and optimize

## Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.) for a demo
```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files
```bash
yarn lint
# or
npm run lint
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.config.js](https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli-vite/quasar-config-js).
